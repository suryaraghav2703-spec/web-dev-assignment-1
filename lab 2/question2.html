    <p>A Rajput king of Mewar from the Sisodia clan, Maharana Pratap is revered for his valor and unyielding resistance against the expansionist policies of the Mughal emperor Akbar. After the 1576 Battle of Haldighati, where the Mughals defeated his army, he continued a relentless guerrilla war from the hills and successfully reclaimed most of his kingdom by his death. His legacy is a powerful symbol of Rajput independence and courage.</p><br>

    <p>Chittor Fort, the former capital of Mewar, was built in the 7th century and was a significant Rajput stronghold known for its brave defenders and multiple sieges, including those by Sultan Bahadur Shah (1535) and Emperor Akbar (1567), culminating in its eventual return to the Mewar rulers in 1616 after a treaty with the Mughals</p><br>

<p>The Ashoka Stambhs, or Pillars of Ashoka, are a series of monolithic columns erected by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka between 268 and 232 BCE. After witnessing the brutality of the Kalinga War, Ashoka converted to Buddhism and dedicated his reign to spreading its moral and ethical teachings, known as Dharma. The pillars were a key part of this effort, acting as lasting monuments to his reformed rule</p>
